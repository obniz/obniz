  Default color_depth = 1. Which means 1 bit represents 1 dot. 1 byte is part of one line. Order is same like. Below is obniz baord series example<br/>
  {1byte} {2byte} {3byte}...{16byte}<br/>
  {17byte} {18byte} {19byte}...<br/>
  .....<br/>
  .....................{1024byte}<br>
  <br>
  Number of line and column depends on device.<br>
  If a device has a color display. You can choose other color_depth mode<br>
  <br>
  color_depth = 4 (4 bit color mode).<br>
  [{4bit for first(left) pixel}, {4bit for next pixel}]<br>
  4 bit represents R_G_B_Brightness<br>
  <br>
  color_depth = 16 means 16bit color mode. So 2 byte for 1 pixel. It is known as RGB565.<br>
  [{8-15bit for one pixel}][{0-7bit for one pixel}]
